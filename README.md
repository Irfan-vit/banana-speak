1. the input will be shown in converted minion language

## Note

the [api](https://funtranslations.com/api/) has restricted the api calls for given time.
if the no.of api calls exceed the limitation then the input will not show any outoput if you are facing this
it is because of this limitation otherwise the app is working fine.
